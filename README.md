# Task Description:
To create a solution for detoxing text with high level of toxicity. It can be a model or set of models, or any algorithm that would work.


# Introduction
I am new at Large Language models, so I started from reading papers. There were some open-source solutions, but the training process requires a lot of computational resources. I started from scratch but  quickly came to fine-tuning of models.
